# ansible-k8s
Ansible playbook to configure the k8s.espinoza.dev cluster. This must be applied to the machine generated by [fdns/terraform-k8s](https://github.com/fdns/terraform-k8s) (Generic aws spot instance fleet)

All variables are defined in the default folder of their respective role, and are encrypted using ansible-vault.

## Roles
This playbook contains the following roles:
- docker: Setup docker for kubelet
- kubelet: Kubelet service installation.
- kubeadm-master: Single master setup using kubeadm.
- kubeadm-slave: Node configuration for the k8s cluster.
- kubernetes-user: Setup fdns user for external access, and generate a local *fdns.conf* file for access.
- ssh-keys: Add ssh keys to the node.
- wireguard: Setup wireguard server.

The setup is completely automatic, and generates a working k8s cluster, where pods can be scheduled on master and slaves.
